# NFCWifi
## An eK production.
This app enables you to connect specified wifi by nfc tech. It can write parsable data to a nfc tag, or read spicified message from one. It's also able to write url, application launch message to a tag.

All of the above is done in my own way, as you know the android system has already been able to do two things of above. The app requires further development.

As I'm a middle school student, the development period should be tough & long. But I'll try my best.

ps. __Don't__ interrupt, I have to finish this on my own.
