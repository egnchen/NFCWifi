# NFCWifi
## An eK production.
This app enables you to connect to specified wifi by nfc tech. It can write parsable data to a nfc tag, or read specified message from one. It's also able to write url, application launch message to a tag.

All of the above is done in my own way, for as you know the Android system has already been able to do the two things mentioned above. 

The app still requires further development.
